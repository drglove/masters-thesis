\label{chapter:analysis}

The aim of our analysis is to put limits on the experiments discussed earlier for our particular model.
From a phenomological perspective, it is relatively easy to write down a model's Lagrangian and generate decay or collision events using modern tools.
Our primary tools we use are \texttt{FeynRules} \cite{Alloul:2013bka}, \texttt{FeynCalc} \cite{Mertig:1990an}, and \texttt{MadGraph} \cite{Alwall:2014hca}.
