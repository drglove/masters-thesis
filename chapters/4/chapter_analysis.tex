\label{chapter:analysis}

The aim of our analysis is to put limits on the experiments discussed earlier for our particular model.
In order to do this, we will have to clearly define our model to hand it off to an event generator, where we will finally analyze the final state of each event.
From a phenomological perspective, it is relatively easy to generate decay or collision events using modern tools, given a model's Lagrangian.
