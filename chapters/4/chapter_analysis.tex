\label{chapter:analysis}

The aim of our analysis is to put limits on the experiments discussed earlier for our particular model.
From a phenomological perspective, it is relatively easy to write down a model's Lagrangian and generate decay or collision events using modern tools.
Our primary tools we use are \feynrules \cite{Alloul:2013bka}, \feyncalc \cite{Mertig:1990an}, and \madgraph \cite{Alwall:2014hca}.
