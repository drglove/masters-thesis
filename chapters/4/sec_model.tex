\section{Models}

Our primary model of interest is the addition of a scalar, $\phi$, with a weak coupling to leptons.
We are also interested in the dark photon model, as it provides a similar low mass mediator that is weakly coupled to leptons.
In the dark photon model, this is instead a vector as opposed to a scalar.
