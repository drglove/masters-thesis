\section{Models}

Keeping in mind that the discrepancy of the proton-charge radius is about $4\%$, we must be interested in rather small couplings \cite{Carlson:2015jba}.
Our primary model of interest is the addition of a scalar, $\phi$, with a weak, asymmetric coupling to leptons that violates lepton universality.
We are also interested in the dark photon model, as it provides a similar low mass mediator that is weakly coupled to leptons.
In the dark photon model, this is instead a vector as opposed to a scalar.

\subsection{Dark Photon}
The dark photon model adds a new $U(1)'$ force where the mediator now carries a mass.
Giving the dark photon, known as $A'$ (or alternatively the $V$), a kinetic mixing with the photon allows it to couple to charged particles with a coupling that depends on the mixing strength.
This model has been thoroughly examined in the literature in connection with dark matter physics, and is a fairly general extension to the SM \cite{Holdom:1985ag}.
It also has potential to solve the $(g-2)_\mu$ problem \cite{Pospelov:2008zw}, however, more recently the parameter space for the simplest model has effectively closed off the dark photon as a solution to $(g-2)_\mu$~\cite{Batley:2015lha}.

The simplest version of the dark photon Lagrangian is given below in equation~\ref{eqn:darkphoton_lagrangian}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:darkphoton_lagrangian}
\Lagr = -\frac{1}{4}F'^2_{\mu\nu} + \frac{1}{2}m_{A'}^2 A'^2_\mu - \frac{\epsilon}{2}F'_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} + \Lagr_{\textrm{SM}}
\end{equation}
Here $F'_{\mu\nu} \equiv \partial_\mu A'_\nu - \partial_\nu A'_\mu$ is the field strength tensor corresponding to the dark photon vector field $A'_\mu$, $F_{\mu\nu}$ is the typical QED electromagnetic field strength tensor, $m_{A'}$ is the corresponding dark photon mass, and $\epsilon$ is the kinetic mixing strength.
The mass term appearing here actually could be inserted from a new Higgs field breaking the $U(1)'$ symmetry, and the QED field strength tensor could be replaced with the $F^Y_{\mu\nu}$ tensor from the SM $U(1)^Y$ electroweak group.
From a phenomenological point of view, it is sufficient to leave the mass term as it appears for our purposes.

After integrating the kinetic mixing term appearing in the Lagrangian by parts, the coupling to charged leptons (and quarks) becomes
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:darkphoton_qed_current}
    \Lagr \supset \epsilon A'_\mu J^\mu_{EM}
\end{equation}
where $J^\mu_{EM} \equiv e \bar{\psi} \gamma^\mu \psi$ is the electromagnetic current.
We then have a coupling between fermions and the dark photon with strength $\epsilon e$, {\em i.e.}\ it looks just like the typical QED coupling but suppressed by a factor of $\epsilon$.
Taking the dark photon to decay to SM particles, we have that the partial width of the dark photon to go to a lepton pair is given by,

\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_{A' \rightarrow \ell^+ \ell^-} = \frac{\alpha \epsilon^2}{3} m_{A'} \sqrt{1-\frac{4 m_\ell^2}{m_{A'}^2}}\left(1 + \frac{2 m_\ell^2}{m_{A'}^2}\right)
\end{equation}

\noindent which yields the convenient decay length when decaying to electrons to be given by~\cite{Echenard:2014lma},

\begin{equation}
    c \tau_{A' \rightarrow e^+ e^-} \approx 0.8~\textrm{mm} \left(\frac{10^{-4}}{\epsilon}\right)^2 \frac{10~\textrm{MeV}}{m_{A'}}\textrm{.}
\end{equation}

\noindent One can see that for small $\epsilon$, the additional signature of the $A'$ could be its displaced decay, away from the point where it has been produced.

In this model, the coupling to each lepton is the same.
It is not immediately clear that one can have an asymmetric effect across leptons on the charged proton radius, or the magnetic moment.
However, in the case where a muon is concerned, the virtual particles may be much more massive.
For this reason, the muon is much more sensitive to undiscovered particles, such as an $A'$, than the electron, regardless of the couplings being the same between muon and electron.
This minimal model proved sufficient for an explanation of $(g-2)_\mu$, but did not quite work for the proton radius anomaly.
A plot of the current limits of the parameter space in $\epsilon^2$ and $m_{A'}$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:darkphoton_limits}.

The red band displays the region where the minimal dark photon model could explain $(g-2)_\mu$, and the dark blue region indicates the region ruled out by measurements of $(g-2)_e$. Recently NA48/2 has ruled out the possibility of the minimal model solving the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.}
    \label{fig:darkphoton_limits}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dark Scalar}
The Lagrangian we use for the addition of a scalar will replicate some features of the Higgs' Lagrangian after electroweak symmetry breaking, which couples to leptons.
We add a real scalar with Yukawa couplings to the three generations of mass, and a standard kinetic term, where the coupling strength is proportional to the mass of the lepton.
This obviously requires picking a mass scale for the coupling, one of the two free parameters in the theory.
The other free parameter is, of course, the mass of the new particle.
Choosing the coupling to scale proportionally to the mass may give a natural way to couple the new scalar more strongly to the muon than for the electron.
The full Lagrangian is given below,
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:scalar_lagrangian}
\Lagr = \frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu \phi \partial^\mu \phi - \frac{1}{2} m_\phi^2 \phi^2 + \sum_{\ell=e,\mu,\tau} g_{\phi \ell}~\bar{\ell}^\lambda~\phi~\ell^\lambda + g_{\phi p}~\bar{p}~\phi~p + \Lagr_{\textrm{SM}}
% g_{\phi e}\bar{e}^\lambda e^\lambda \phi
\end{equation}
where $\ell$ takes on the lepton fields, $g_{\phi \ell}$ are the couplings between the scalar and the corresponding lepton, $p$ is the proton field, $g_{\phi p}$ is the coupling between the scalar and the proton, and $\Lagr_\textrm{SM}$ is the SM Lagrangian.
$\lambda$ indicates spinor indices, and $g_{\phi \ell} \propto m_\ell$.
We usually fix the coupling to the muon in this thesis, however we will also fix the coupling to the tau in one sectionso it is convenient to write the couplings as
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:coupling_mass}
g_{\phi \ell} = \left(g_{\phi e}, g_{\phi \mu}, g_{\phi \tau}\right) = g_{\phi \mu} \left( \frac{m_e}{m_\mu}, 1, \frac{m_\tau}{m_\mu} \right) = g_{\phi \tau} \left( \frac{m_e}{m_\tau}, \frac{m_\mu}{m_\tau}, 1 \right)\textrm{.}
\end{equation}

It is important to point out that this Lagrangian does not possess $SU(2) \times U(1)$ gauge invariance, as Yukawa interactions with leptons explicitly break this gauge symmetry. 
This is a hint that this theory is not UV complete, and at best represents a low-energy limit of a more consistent theory.
However, a UV complete version of this model, respecting $SU(2) \times U(1)$ gauge invariance, has been worked out that involves a SM neutral light scalar and a leptonic-specific two Higgs-doublet model \cite{Batell:2015unpub}.

With this model, the partial decay widths of the $\phi$ to a pair of leptons goes as

\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_{\phi \rightarrow \ell^+ \ell^-} = \frac{1}{8\pi} g_{\phi\ell}^2 m_\phi \left(1-\frac{4m_\ell^2}{m_\phi^2}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\textrm{.}
\end{equation}

Loop induced diagrams also allow the production of a pair of photons, $\phi \rightarrow \gamma \gamma$, which is computed with the diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:phi_gammagamma_loop}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.6\textwidth]{Figures/feynman_diagrams/phi_gammagamma}
    \caption{Loop diagram for $\phi \rightarrow \gamma \gamma$, mediated by an exchange of leptons.}
    \label{fig:phi_gammagamma_loop}
\end{figure}

\noindent This production has a small branching ratio, except for masses of the scalar near the production threshold for a pair of muons of taus.
Since $\phi$ is Higgs-like, we can make use of the known results for $\Gamma\left(H \rightarrow \gamma \gamma\right)$ in \cite{Djouadi:2005gi}, and simply rescale the result to match our scalar.
Doing this yields

\begin{equation}
    \Gamma\left(\phi \rightarrow \gamma \gamma\right) = \frac{\alpha^2}{256 \pi^3} \frac{m_\phi^3}{m_\mu^2} g_{\phi \mu}^2 \left( \sum_{\ell = \mu, \tau} \frac{2}{x_\ell^2}\left( x_\ell + (x_\ell-1) \arcsin^2\left( \sqrt{x_\ell} \right) \right) \theta(1-x_\ell) \right)^2
\end{equation}

\noindent where $x_\ell = m_\phi^2 / 4 m_\ell^2$, and $\theta(x)$ is the Heaviside step function.
We do not take into account the resonant production of the leptons appearing in the diagram, hence the lack of electrons appearing in the sum, and the Heaviside function appearing to turn off the contribution above the resonant production threshold.
At low masses of the $\phi$, the contribution from both the muon and tau loop are identical, as we couple stronger to the more massive tau in such a way that both cases are identical.
This correction is small in this region, compared to the partial width of $\phi \rightarrow e^+ e^-$.
However, near $m_\phi = 2m_\mu$, this process can have a branching ratio up to $20\%$.
This is taken into account in our analysis by simply scaling the number of signal events by the correct branching ratio.
It is possible to take this production of photons into account as a source of signal, and to include the appropriate backgrounds, but this is outside the scope of this work.

The largest implication of this decay width for us is the relative partial widths between muons and electrons as the decay products.
Once the muon channel opens up, {\em i.e.}\ when $m_\phi > 2 m_\mu \gg 2 m_e$, and taking the total width to only have contributions from the $e^+ e^-$ and $\mu^+ \mu^-$ channels, we have that

\begin{align}
    \textrm{BR}(\phi \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-) &\approx \frac{1}{1+\frac{\Gamma\left(\phi \rightarrow e^+ e^-\right)}{\Gamma\left(\phi \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-\right)}} \\
    \frac{\Gamma_{\phi \rightarrow e^+ e^-}}{\Gamma_{\phi \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-}} &\approx \frac{m_e^2}{m_\mu^2}\left(1-\frac{4m_\mu^2}{m_\phi^2}\right)^{-\frac{3}{2}}\textrm{.}
\end{align}

\noindent Due to the suppression from the leading $m_e^2/m_\mu^2$ term, once the decay to muons is kinematically accessible due to the large mass of the $\phi$, one can effectively neglect the branching ratio to the electrons and take $\textrm{BR}(\phi \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-) \approx 1$.
A plot of the branching ratio to a dimuon pair is shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:br_phi}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.6\textwidth]{Figures/misc/br_phi}
    \caption[Branching ratios of the scalar to a pair of leptons or a pair of photons.]{Branching ratios of the scalar to a pair of leptons or to a pair of photons. Blue corresponds to $\phi \rightarrow e^+ e^-$, green to $\phi \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-$, red to $\phi \rightarrow \tau^+ \tau^-$, and orange to $\phi \rightarrow \gamma \gamma$. Going slightly above the threshold mass to produce pairs of muons gives a branching ratio of $1$ almost immediately. Note the contribution from the loop induced production of photons is appreciable just to the left of $m_\phi = 2 m_\mu$.}
    \label{fig:br_phi}
\end{figure}

This has the consequence of allowing us to estimate sensitivity limits in an easier fashion, as we need only take into account the electron decay channel and photon production channel, until the muon is accessible (where it dominates), and similarly for the tau.
In all of our cases, we will be taking the $\phi$ to be produced on-shell before decaying to an $\ell^+ \ell^-$ pair promptly, as the width of the scalar as given above is very small, and the branching ratio to the most massive pair of leptons is very close to $1$.

If we examine the decay length, where the electron is the only accessible lepton and for masses of the mediator much larger than the electron, we find

\begin{equation}
    c \tau_{\phi \rightarrow e^+ e^-} \approx 0.05~\textrm{mm} \left(\frac{10^{-4}}{g_{\phi e}}\right)^2 \frac{10~\textrm{MeV}}{m_\phi}\textrm{.}
\end{equation}

\noindent The decay length is plotted in Fig.\ \ref{fig:ctau_phi}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.6\textwidth]{Figures/misc/ctau_phi}
    \caption[The typical decay length of the scalar.]{The typical decay length of the scalar. The strength of the coupling between $\phi$ and the electron is taken to be $g_{\phi e} = 10^{-4}$. One can see the different decay modes turn on, at the $2 m_\mu$ and $2 m_\tau$ thresholds, while the effects due to the loop diagram $\phi \rightarrow \gamma \gamma$ do not have a sizable impact on the decay length.}
    \label{fig:ctau_phi}
\end{figure}

Of most importance is the relative magnitude of the couplings.
We would like a weak coupling to electrons such that we do not disturb the proton radius as extracted in the electron-proton scattering experiments, and in measurements of the atomic energy levels of electronic Hydrogen.
Indeed the point here is to have a stronger coupling to the muon with the scalar than that of the electron with the scalar.
Taking the couplings to be Higgs-like gives the size of any physical effect to be approximately some power of $(m_\mu/m_e) \approx 210$ times larger for the muon than to the electron.
Therefore, it is advantageous to produce such a scalar by radiating it off of the heaviest lepton kinematically accessible in any given process.

It is also possible to allow for a pseudo-scalar coupling to be included by introducing another set of couplings to the pseudo-scalar field with an $i\gamma^5$ between the spinors.
While it is outside the scope of this thesis to examine this, we will note here that the scalar and pseudo-scalar have corrections to $(g-2)_\mu$ with opposing signs.
This is given in more detail in~\cite{Carlson:2015jba}.

Since the phenomena we are trying to describe are the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the muonic atom's Lamb shift, we will discuss how the scalar model modifies these in detail.
The corrections to $(g-2)_\mu$ are given at the one loop level by \cite{Leveille:1977rc, McKeen:2009ny, TuckerSmith:2010ra}.
A convenient form for the contribution from the addition of a scalar is given below.

\begin{align}
    \Delta a_\mu &= \frac{\alpha}{2\pi} \left(\frac{g_{\phi\mu}}{e}\right)^2 \xi\left(\frac{m_\phi}{m_\mu}\right) \\
    \xi(x) &= \int_0^1 \frac{(1-z)^2(1+z)}{(1-z)^2 + x^2z} \,dz
\end{align}

\noindent This form of $\Delta a_\mu$ will be useful when plotting our proposed sensitivity limits.
For the case where $m_\phi \ll m_\mu$, the integral $\xi \rightarrow 3/2$, giving an $m_\phi$ independent constraint on the coupling constant in this region.
When we are in the region where $m_\phi \gg m_\mu$, the contribution at one loop scales as $\Delta a_\mu \propto (m_\mu/m_\phi)^2$, or similarly, the constraining coupling must scale as $g_{\phi\mu} \propto m_\phi / m_\mu$.
Overall we have the following asymptotic behaviour:

\begin{equation}
    \Delta a_\mu = \frac{\alpha}{2\pi} \left(\frac{g_{\phi \mu}}{e}\right)^2
    \begin{cases}
        \frac{3}{2}, & m_\phi \ll m_\mu \\
        \frac{m_\mu^2}{m_\phi^2} \left(2\ln\left(\frac{m_\phi}{m_\mu}\right) - \frac{7}{6}\right), & m_\phi \gg m_\mu
    \end{cases}\textrm{,}
\end{equation}

\noindent and at a specific mass

\begin{equation}
    \Delta a_\mu\left(m_\phi = 50~\textrm{MeV}\right) = \frac{\alpha}{2\pi} \left(\frac{g_{\phi\mu}}{10^{-4}}\right)^2 8.6\times 10^{-8}\textrm{.}
\end{equation}

The muonic atom's Lamb shift correction from the addition of a scalar can be found through first-order perturbation theory, and is given by \cite{TuckerSmith:2010ra, Carlson:2015jba}

\begin{align}
    \delta E_\phi &= \int r^2 V_\phi(r)\left(\left|R_{20}(r)\right|^2 - \left|R_{21}(r)\right|^2\right)\,dr \\
                  &= \frac{\alpha}{2 a^3} \left(\frac{g_{\phi\mu} g_{\phi p}}{e^2}\right) \frac{f(a m_\phi)}{m_\phi^2} \textrm{,}
\end{align}

\noindent where $f(x) = x^4/(1+x)^4$, $a = 1/(\alpha m_{\mu p})$ is the Bohr radius of the $\mu\textrm{H}$ system, and $m_{\mu p}$ is the reduced mass of the system.
While this correction has proven to be a good motivation, and one can extract expected sensitivities from it with a constraint from the measurement of $r_p$, there is still a degeneracy in this expression that proves difficult to work around.
Since the coupling to the proton must be included, we only see the product $g_{\phi\mu} g_{\phi p}$ enter in the above expression, which makes it difficult to place sensitivity limits on $g_{\phi\mu}$ without making assumptions on the coupling to the proton.
For this reason, $(g-2)_\mu$ proves to provide better context for the sensitivity limits we will explore.
