\section{Models}

Our primary model of interest is the addition of a scalar, $\phi$, with a weak coupling to leptons.
We are also interested in the dark photon model, as it provides a similar low mass mediator that is weakly coupled to leptons.
In the dark photon model, this is instead a vector as opposed to a scalar.

\subsection{Extra Scalar}
The Lagrangian we use for the addition of a scalar ends up looking like the Higgs' Lagrangian after electroweak symmetry breaking, which couples to leptons.
We add a real scalar with Yukawa couplings to the three generations of mass, and a standard kinetic term, where the coupling strength is proportional to the mass of the lepton. This obviously requires picking a mass scale for the coupling, one of two free parameters of the theory. The other free parameter is, as usual, the mass of the new particle.
The full Lagrangian is given in below, equation \ref{eqn:scalar_lagrangian}: \unsure{below?} 
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:scalar_lagrangian}
\Lagr = \frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu \phi \partial^\mu \phi - \frac{1}{2} m_\phi^2 \phi^2 + \sum_{\ell=e,\mu,\tau} g_{\phi \ell}\bar{\ell}^\lambda \ell^\lambda \phi + \Lagr_{\textrm{SM}}
% g_{\phi e}\bar{e}^\lambda e^\lambda \phi
\end{equation}\unsure{Sum over leptons?} 
where the couplings in $g_{\phi \ell}$ are the couplings between the scalar and the corresponding lepton, $\Lagr_\textrm{SM}$ is the Standard Model Lagrangian, $\lambda$ indicates spinor indices, and $g_{\phi \ell} \sim m_\ell$.
We usually fix the coupling to the $\mu$ in this thesis, however we will also fix the coupling to the $\tau$ in one portion so it is convenient to write the couplings as:
\begin{equation*}
\label{eqn:coupling_mass}
g_{\phi \ell} = \left(g_{\phi e}, g_{\phi \mu}, g_{\phi \tau}\right) = g_{\phi \mu} \left( \frac{m_e}{m_\mu}, 1, \frac{m_\tau}{m_\mu} \right)
\end{equation}
