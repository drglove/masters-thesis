\startchapter{Review of Interesting Muonic Features}
\label{chapter:review}

The main motivation for the thesis is that there exist experimental anomalies that have yet to be explained, or disappear as statistically isignificant.
This chapter is dedicated to investigating these anomalies in detail.
There are two main experimental results that motivate light new physics.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The proton radius puzzle, in which the proton radius is extracted from $\mu\textrm{H}$.
    \item $(g-2)$ for the muon, which may be explained by loops of light mediators.
\end{enumerate}

We will also discuss an alternative theory to the scalar we put forward to test, that may solve the problems above, known as the dark photon.
