\startchapter{Review of Interesting Muonic Features}
\label{chapter:review}

The main motivation for the thesis is that there exist experimental anomalies that have yet to be explained, or disappear as statistically isignificant.
This chapter is dedicated to investigating these anomalies in detail.
There are two main experimental results that motivate light new physics for our purposes.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The proton radius puzzle, in which the proton radius is extracted from $\mu\textrm{H}$.
    \item $(g-2)$ for the muon, which may be explained by loops of light mediators.
\end{enumerate}

We will also discuss an alternative theory to the scalar we put forward to test, that may solve the problems above, known as the dark photon.
Both of these concern the muon, which may provide a hint as of where to look for new interesting phenomenon not yet explained by the SM.
Within the SM, there is no lepton flavour violation, except when one adds neutrino masses, at which point charged lepton flavour violation becomes allowed, but is suppressed by the incredibly small masses of the neutrinos which must oscillate to produce the effect.
This tells us that, if we take into account the masses of the charged leptons correctly, then physics should be no different when we replace an electron with a muon.
Of course this has limits, since the muon can decay to an electron and anti-muon neutrino, and the electron has no decay modes we are aware of, but this is more a question of allowable kinematics.
To have fundamentally different interactions between a muon and other SM particles would be a smoking gun for new physics.
