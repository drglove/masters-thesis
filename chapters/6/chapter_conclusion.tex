Our goal for this thesis was to find the sensitivity of three classes of experiments to a new $\textrm{MeV}$ scale force.
Utilizing the Monte Carlo generator \madgraph, we were able to phenomenologically explore the new scalar particle.
Restricting this particle to decay only to SM particles, in particular, pairs of leptons, allows one to put stringent bounds on the coupling, down to the level of $10^{-5}$ for the coupling to the muon.
Much of this parameter space is explored for the dark photon, but lots of this space for the scalar remains unexplored, and if nature were to choose the parameters correctly it could serve as an explanation for the proton radius problem.
Upcoming experiments offer a chance to test physics at the intensity frontier, where many decays and collisions take place, allowing restrictions on branching ratios of SM physics to be placed down to the level of $10^{-16}$ in the coming years.
These will not only be used to test this model of course, but there are many other low mass theories that will be tested.
