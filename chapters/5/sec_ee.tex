\section{Limits on B-factories from $e^+ e^-$ Collisions}
For $e^+ e^-$ collisions, we make use of \madgraph again to handle our signal and background estimates.
Most of what was said about generation of events for the muon events holds here.

The total integrated luminosities at \belle is taken to be $1040.86fb^{-1}$, with \belleii to be expected to have around $100$ times this.
Since the centre of mass energy reaches $10.58\textrm{GeV}$, we can access the $\tau$ leptons here, which in our model have a very strong coupling to the scalar due to their large mass of $1.777\textrm{GeV}$.
There are two regions of interest in this scenario for the mass of the mediator: below, and above the threshold for the scalar to decay to muons.
Below this it can only decay to an $e^+ e^-$ pair, so the overall process for $m_\phi < 2m_\mu$ is

\begin{equation}
    e^+ + e^- \rightarrow \tau^+ + \tau^- + e^+ + e^-
\end{equation}

\noindent while above this threshold we decay almost exclusively to muons.

\begin{equation}
    e^+ + e^- \rightarrow \tau^+ + \tau^- + \mu^+ + \mu^-
\end{equation}
