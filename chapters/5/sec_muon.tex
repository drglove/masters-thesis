\section{Limits on \mueee from Muon Decays}
In section \ref{sec:mu3e_experiment}, we saw how the production rate of $\mu^+$ at \mueee could be brought to the level of muon decays occuring at a rate $\order(10^9) \mu^+/s$.
The signal for the \mueee experiment, $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ e^+ e^-$, contains no missing energy as there are no neutrinos in the final state.
Since the experiment is looking at a muon beam, it can be expected that there will be many events that behave like a muon decay and have missing energy.
The SM has many avenues to produce such a signal with missing energy through muon decay, and we will go through the relevant backgrounds to our limits here.
