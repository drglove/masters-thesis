\section{Limits on NA48/2 and NA62 from Charged Kaon Decays}
In contrast to the previous section on muon decay, kaon decay is relatively easy to handle and can be done even analytically.
While NA48/2 and NA62 won't reach a number of kaon decays comparable to the muon decays, we still have $2.0 \times 10^{11}$ $K^+$ decays at NA48/2 and an expected $9.0 \times 10^{12}$ $K^+$ decays at NA62.
These numbers are large enough to put strong bounds on the scalar, but these will not be as strong.
Furthermore, the background is more complicated and requires special treatment, which we will talk about now.
