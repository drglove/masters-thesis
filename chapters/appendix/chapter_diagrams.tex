\startappendix{\madgraph Generated Feynman Diagrams}
\label{app:madgraph_diagrams}
For any processes that are sampled using \madgraph, the resulting diagrams used are all displayed here.

\section{Muon Decay}
\label{app:muon_diagrams}
These are all the Feynman diagrams when doing the muon decay calculation.
Here we sample the background, the scalar signal, and also the dark photon signal.

\subsection{Standard Model Background}
All background diagrams sampled are shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:mu_eeenunu_bkg}. 
Note that some of these diagrams have multiple $W$ propagators, and will be heavily suppressed by an extra factor of $G_F^2$ compared to the diagrams with a signal $W$.
There are also diagrams which were omitted carrying a $Z$ instead of a photon, and of course the Higgs diagrams are excluded without any loss of accuracy.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Scalar Signal}
All signal diagrams sampled for the scalar are shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:mu_eee_scalar}.
In these diagrams, keep in mind that the scalar is required to be \emph{on-shell}.
It is also assumed that the scalar has a narrow width and will decay promptly.
This restricts the number of diagrams and also forces \madgraph to compute the decay as a decay chain instead of a single decay.

    \caption{Signal contribution to muon decay from the scalar field. The scalar is taken to be on-shell where it decays to an $e^+ e^-$ pair.}
    \label{fig:mu_eee_scalar}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dark Photon Signal}
All signal diagrams sampled for the dark photon are shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:mu_eee_darkphoton}.
Again, the dark photon here is required to be produced \emph{on-shell}.
The same comment regarding the width of the dark photon can be said here.

\section{$e^+ e^-$ Collisions at B-factories}
\label{app:ee_diagrams}
Here all the diagrams generated by \madgraph in the calculations of $e^+ e^-$ collision cross sections.
\unsure{There are a lot of diagrams. Should I really include them all?}
