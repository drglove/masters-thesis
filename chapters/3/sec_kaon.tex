\section{Kaon Decay at NA48/2 and NA62}
NA48/2 and NA62 (also known as NA48/3) are two experiments studying rare kaon decays at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS).
The first experiment of the two finished taking data in 2004, yet limits on new physics can still be done using the data collected on tape.
NA48/2 was primarily designed to look for charge-parity (CP) violation in the decays of the charged kaons:

\begin{align}
K^\pm & \rightarrow \pi^+ + \pi^- + \pi^\pm \\
K^\pm & \rightarrow \pi^0 + \pi^0 + \pi^\pm
\end{align}
