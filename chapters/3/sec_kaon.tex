\section{Charged Kaon Decays at the Super Proton Synchrotron}
\label{sec:na48_na62_experiment}
NA48/2~\cite{Batley:1999fv} and NA62~\cite{Martellotti:2015kna} (also known as NA48/3) are two experiments studying rare kaon decays at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS).

\subsection{NA48/2}
The first experiment of the two finished taking data in 2004, yet limits on new physics can still be done using the data collected on tape.
NA48/2 is based on the upgraded NA48 experiment, and was primarily designed to look for charge-parity (CP) violation in the decays of the charged kaons:

\begin{align}
K^\pm & \rightarrow \pi^+ + \pi^- + \pi^\pm \\
K^\pm & \rightarrow \pi^0 + \pi^0 + \pi^\pm
\end{align}

\subsection{NA62}
On the other hand, NA62 is looking to measure the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element $|V_{td}|$ at the level of $10\%$ by measuring the very rare charged kaon decay:
\begin{equation}
K^+ \rightarrow \pi^+ + \nu + \bar{\nu}
\end{equation}
This branching ratio in the SM comes at $\textrm{BR}(K^+ \rightarrow \pi^+ + \nu + \bar{\nu}) = (7.81 \pm 0.75 \pm 0.29) \times 10^{-11}$, with the first uncertainty being due to the uncertain input parameters, and the second uncertainty being due to theoretical uncertainty~\cite{Straub:2010ih}.
The relative size of this branching ratio should allow one to put strong limits on any new physics involving the charged kaons.
In October 2014, NA62 successfully launched and began taking data.
